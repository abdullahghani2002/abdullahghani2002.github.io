I am a recent Computer Science graduate from LUMS, where I achieved the highest GPA in my major (4.00/4.00). My research focuses on conducting large-scale empirical measurements to build more secure, transparent, and trustworthy networked systems. I am passionate about using my findings to inform evidence-based public policy.

I am currently seeking PhD positions in Computer Science for Fall 2026.

## Recent News

*   **October 2025:** Our paper, "PixelConfig," on reverse-engineering the Meta Pixel received a **one-shot revision** decision from **ACM IMC 2025**.
*   **October 2025:** Our work on auditing children's advertising on YouTube was submitted to **The ACM Web Conference (WWW) 2026**.
*   **August 2025:** Our paper on the "confidence paradox" in AI fact-checking is now under review at **Nature Scientific Reports**.

## Selected Publications

*(Note: The most effective academic websites often have a dedicated "Publications" page, but for a single-page site, this is the best format.)*

*(You would then remove the old "Research Experience" and "Publications" sections from this page. Those detailed paragraphs are perfect for creating separate project pages later, which you can link to.)*
## Teaching Experience

1. **Data Science**              (Fall 2024)  
2. **Data Structures**           (Spring 2024)  
3. **Discrete Mathematics**      (Fall 2023)  

Apart from solidifying my own understanding of these subjects in unanticipated ways, taking on the role of a teaching assistant has allowed me to:
- Creatively design programming assignments (e.g., AVL Trees in C++, Causal Inference in Python).  
- Structure comprehensive exams and quizzes.  
- Deliver live tutorials and supervise semester-long data science projects.  
- Use code-similarity checkers (e.g., JPlag) to maintain academic integrity.  

## Awards and Honours

- **Full Merit Scholarship Award**: Granted to the top 3 students from LUMS SBASSE Batch of 2025 for the 2022-2023, 2023-2024, and 2024-2025 academic years.  
- **Dean’s Honour List**: Awarded for the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 academic years.  
- **Top Candidate at School (A Levels)**: Achieved the highest grades at Lahore Grammar School Defence.  
- **Top 20 National Mathematics Talent Contest**: Shortlisted from candidates across Pakistan to represent Pakistan at the International Mathematics Olympiad.
- **Academic Excellence**: Scored an A+ in over 70% of my courses.

## Miscellaneous

- A very helpful [resource](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf) for graduate school applications that greatly aided me in my journey.  
- Some [golden advice](https://ihsan-qazi.blogspot.com/2010/08/few-pieces-of-advice-i-gave-to-my.html) from my mentor, Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi, that I strive to follow in my academic and personal growth.
