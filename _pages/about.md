I’m a recent BS CS graduate (and aspiring Ph.D. candidate) from the [Lahore University of Management Sciences](https://lums.edu.pk/). I investigate how large-scale networked systems and applications impact users on the web through measurements, highlighting gaps in privacy, safety, and trust between systems and society. Consequently, I am interested in developing more reliable, transparent, and accessible networked systems.


## Research Experience

### Misinformation and Digital Safety
Since my sophomore year, I have been working on an ambitious research project under the supervision of **[Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi](https://ihsanqazi.com)**, investigating how Large Language Models (LLMs) function as fact-checkers in the context of misinformation. To address this challenge, we curated a meticulously annotated, high-quality dataset of over 200,000 real-world claims and evaluated LLMs using zero-shot, unstructured prompts. This approach, designed to mirror a typical layperson's interaction, demanded substantial manual effort to ensure accuracy and reliability. Our downstream analysis revealed fascinating insights, such as the presence of **regional, lingual, and psychological biases** in LLMs, their potential to propagate misinformation, and areas for improvement in state-of-the-art models. Owing to the **scale, originality, and rigor** of our findings, we are finalizing a draft for submission to the prestigious journal **[Science](https://www.science.org/)**.

### Privacy and Meaurement
Since my junior year, I have also been collaborating with **[Dr. Zubair Shafiq](https://web.cs.ucdavis.edu/~zubair/)** and **[Dr. Fareed Zaffar](https://dblp.org/pid/59/3605.html)** to develop a system that uncovers how websites track user behavior using the **Meta Pixel** over time. Although developers can access public-facing configuration files of the Meta Pixel, no prior research has delved into the **minified and obfuscated code** within these files. Using advanced crawlers, I detected the Meta Pixel's presence across websites and retrieved historical configurations via the [Wayback Machine](https://wayback.archive.org/). By building **custom parsers** and performing detailed **differential analyses**, I facilitated a deeper understanding of this tracking technology. As a result, I have designed **[Pixel Excavator](https://pixel-frontend-1glb.onrender.com/)**, a first-of-its-kind public-facing tool enabling users to analyze the tracking behaviors of prominent and sensitive websites. As a case study, we are now analyzing AMA hospital websites, uncovering that while Meta has implemented restrictions on tracking sensitive visitor data, **significant loopholes remain**. We aim to submit these findings to **[ACM CCS 2025](https://www.sigsac.org/ccs/CCS2025/)**. 

### Usable Security and Privacy
As part of a course project, I also worked with **[Dr. Masooda Bashir](https://ischool.illinois.edu/people/masooda-bashir)'s** group on analyzing **50,000+ user reviews** collected from popular health chatbot applications, employing manual as well as automated evaluations through **BART** and **Gemini**. The study uncovered **security-privacy-related concerns** and user sentiments, highlighting apprehensions felt directly by the users. We proposed a **scalable framework** to identifying such concerns at large scales of reviews, along with a qualitative analysis of the privacy-security-related concerns identified in our sample. The findings are currently under review at the **Symposium on Usable Security and Privacy (USEC) 2025**.

## Teaching Experience

1. **Data Science**              (Fall 2024)  
2. **Data Structures**           (Spring 2024)  
3. **Discrete Mathematics**      (Fall 2023)  

Apart from solidifying my own understanding of these subjects in unanticipated ways, taking on the role of a teaching assistant has allowed me to:
- Creatively design programming assignments (e.g., AVL Trees in C++, Causal Inference in Python).  
- Structure comprehensive exams and quizzes.  
- Deliver live tutorials and supervise semester-long data science projects.  
- Use code-similarity checkers (e.g., JPlag) to maintain academic integrity.  

## Awards and Honours

- **Full Merit Scholarship Award**: Granted to the top 3 students from LUMS SBASSE Batch of 2025 for the 2022-2023, 2023-2024, and 2024-2025 academic years.  
- **Dean’s Honour List**: Awarded for the 2021-2022, 2022-2023, and 2023-2024 academic years.  
- **Top Candidate at School (A Levels)**: Achieved the highest grades at Lahore Grammar School Defence.  
- **Top 20 National Mathematics Talent Contest**: Shortlisted from candidates across Pakistan to represent Pakistan at the International Mathematics Olympiad.
- **Academic Excellence**: Scored an A+ in over 70% of my courses.

## Miscellaneous

- A very helpful [resource](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~harchol/gradschooltalk.pdf) for graduate school applications that greatly aided me in my journey.  
- Some [golden advice](https://ihsan-qazi.blogspot.com/2010/08/few-pieces-of-advice-i-gave-to-my.html) from my mentor, Dr. Ihsan Ayyub Qazi, that I strive to follow in my academic and personal growth.
